# 👤 Advanced-Real-Time Face Detection with MediaPipe and OpenCV

### 📌 About the Project
This project is a **Real-Time Face Detection System** built using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**. It detects faces in a live video stream, draws bounding boxes around them, and displays detection confidence scores. The FPS (frames per second) is also calculated and displayed for performance monitoring.

✨ **Features**:
- 🚀 Real-time face detection 🧑‍💻
- 🎯 Bounding boxes with confidence scores 📊
- ⏱️ Live FPS display for performance ⚡

## 🛠️ **Installation Steps**
To run this project on your system, follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. 🐍

### 2️⃣ Install Required Libraries
Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
```

🔧 **Libraries**:
- 🖼️ **`opencv-python`**: For video capture and image processing.
- 🤖 **`mediapipe`**: Google's library for face detection and machine learning.

### 3️⃣ Clone the Repository
Download the project files using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/Real-Time-Face-Detection.git
cd Real-Time-Face-Detection
```

---

## 🚀 **How to Run**
Run the Python script with the following command:

```bash
python face_detection.py
```

🎥 A window will open showing:
- 🟣 Detected faces with bounding boxes 🔍
- 💯 Confidence scores displayed above the bounding boxes ✅
- ⏱️ FPS counter on the top left corner 🏁

Press **`q`** to exit the program. ✋

## 🧩 **Code Overview**
Here’s a breakdown of the main sections:

1. 🎥 **Capture Video**: OpenCV captures frames from your webcam.
2. 🤖 **Face Detection**: MediaPipe processes the frames to detect faces.
3. 🟪 **Bounding Boxes**: Rectangles are drawn around detected faces with confidence scores.
4. 🏎️ **FPS Calculation**: The program calculates and displays FPS for performance.
5. 👀 **Visualization**: The annotated video feed is displayed live.

## 🎯 **Output Preview**
You will see:
- 🟪 Faces detected with bounding boxes ✨
- 🎯 Confidence scores (e.g., "95%") ✅
- 🏎️ FPS displayed on the top left corner 📈

Example of output logs:
```
Detections: 2
Face 1: Confidence = 95%
Face 2: Confidence = 87%
```
